# Package Management 5ddda9b1b4c7446cb627f8cefdce424a

It is crucial to have a firm grasp on the available Linux package managers and the various ways to utilize them to install, update, or remove packages. Packages are archives that contain binaries of software, configuration files, information about dependencies and keep track of updates and upgrades. The features that most package management systems provide are:

* Package downloading
* Dependency resolution
* A standard binary package format
* Common installation and configuration locations
* Additional system-related configuration and functionality
* Quality control

## Package Management Process

The package management requirement is that the software to be installed is available as a corresponding package. Typically this is created, offered, and maintained centrally under Linux distributions. In this way, the software is integrated directly into the system, and its various directories are distributed throughout the system. The package management software retrieves the necessary changes for system installation from the package itself and then implements these changes to install the package successfully. If the package management software recognizes that additional packages are required for the proper functioning of the package that has not yet been installed, a dependency is included and either warns the administrator or tries to reload the missing software from a repository, for example, and install it in advance.

If an installed software has been deleted, the package management system then retakes the package's information, modifies it based on its configuration, and deletes files. There are different package management programs that we can use for this. Here is a list of examples of such programs:

| **Command** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dpkg`      | The `dpkg` is a tool to install, build, remove, and manage Debian packages. The primary and more user-friendly front-end for `dpkg` is aptitude.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `apt`       | Apt provides a high-level command-line interface for the package management system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `aptitude`  | Aptitude is an alternative to apt and is a high-level interface to the package manager.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `pip`       | Pip is a Python package installer recommended for installing Python packages that are not available in the Debian archive. It can work with version control repositories (currently only Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar repositories), logs output extensively, and prevents partial installs by downloading all requirements before starting installation. |
| `git`       | Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Advanced Package Manager (APT)

[https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-apt-command/](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-apt-command/)

Always update the package index before upgrading or installing new packages.

Each Linux distribution uses software repositories that are updated often. When we update a program or install a new one, the system queries these repositories for the desired package. Repositories can be labeled as stable, testing, or unstable. Most Linux distributions utilize the most stable or "main" repository. This can be checked by viewing the contents of the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file. The repository list for Parrot OS is at `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/parrot.list`.

Debian-based Linux distributions use the `APT` package manager. A package is an archive file containing multiple ".deb" files. The `dpkg` utility is used to install programs from the associated ".deb" file. `APT` makes updating and installing programs easier because many programs have dependencies.

```bash
JuiceWRLD100@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/parrot.list

# parrot repository# this file was automatically generated by parrot-mirror-selectordeb http://htb.deb.parrot.sh/parrot/ rolling main contrib non-free
#deb-src https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot/ rolling main contrib non-freedeb http://htb.deb.parrot.sh/parrot/ rolling-security main contrib non-free
#deb-src https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot/ rolling-security main contrib non-free
```

APT uses a database called the APT cache. This is used to provide information about packages installed on our system offline. We can search the APT cache, for example, to find all `Impacket` related packages.

```bash
JuiceWRLD100@htb[/htb]$ apt-cache search impacket

impacket-scripts - Links to useful impacket scripts examples
polenum - Extracts the password policy from a Windows system
python-pcapy - Python interface to the libpcap packet capture library (Python 2)
python3-impacket - Python3 module to easily build and dissect network protocols
python3-pcapy - Python interface to the libpcap packet capture library (Python 3)
```

We can then view additional information about a package.

```bash
JuiceWRLD100@htb[/htb]$ apt-cache show impacket-scripts

Package: impacket-scripts
Version: 1.4
Architecture: all
Maintainer: Kali Developers <devel@kali.org>

Depends: python3-impacket (>= 0.9.20), python3-ldap3 (>= 2.5.0), python3-ldapdomaindump

Filename: pool/main/i/impacket-scripts/impacket-scripts_1.4_all.deb

<SNIP>
```

We can also list all installed packages.

```bash
JuiceWRLD100@htb[/htb]$ apt list --installed

Listing... Done
accountsservice/rolling,now 0.6.55-2 amd64 [installed,automatic]
adapta-gtk-theme/rolling,now 3.95.0.11-1 all [installed]

aircrack-ng/rolling,now 1:1.6-4 amd64 [installed,automatic]

```

If we are missing some packages, we can search for it and install it using the following command.

```bash
JuiceWRLD100@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install impacket-scripts -y

## Git

we can use Git to download useful tools from Github. First, we need to navigate to the [project's repository](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) and copy the Github link before using git to download it.

Nevertheless, before we download the project and its scripts and lists, we should create a particular folder.

```bash
JuiceWRLD100@htb[/htb]$ mkdir ~/nishang/ && git clone https://github.com/samratashok/nishang.git ~/nishang

Cloning into '/opt/nishang/'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 15, done.

Resolving deltas: 100% (1055/1055), done.
```

## DPKG

We can also download the programs and tools from the repositories separately. In this example, we download 'strace' for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

```bash
JuiceWRLD100@htb[/htb]$ wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/s/strace/strace_4.21-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb

```

Furthermore, now we can use both `apt` and `dpkg` to install the package. Since we have already worked with `apt`, we will turn to `dpkg` in the next example.

```bash
JuiceWRLD100@htb[/htb]$ sudo dpkg -i strace_4.21-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb

 (Reading database ... 154680 files and directories currently installed.)

Setting up strace (4.21-1ubuntu1) ...
Processing triggers for man-db (2.8.3-2ubuntu0.1) ...
```

With this, we have already installed the tool and can test if it works properly.
