# System Information cb4ff0c8d18d42a3962adcbf57c91976

Since we will be working with many different Linux systems, we need to learn the structure and the information about the system, its processes, network configurations, users, directories, user settings, and the corresponding parameters. Here is a list of the necessary tools that will help us get the above information. Most of them are installed by default.

| **Command** | **Description**                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `whoami`    | Displays current username.                                                                                                         |
| `id`        | Returns users identity                                                                                                             |
| `hostname`  | Sets or prints the name of current host system.                                                                                    |
| `uname`     | Prints basic information about the operating system name and system hardware.                                                      |
| `pwd`       | Returns working directory name.                                                                                                    |
| `ifconfig`  | The ifconfig utility is used to assign or to view an address to a network interface and/or configure network interface parameters. |
| `ip`        | Ip is a utility to show or manipulate routing, network devices, interfaces and tunnels.                                            |

| `env`       | Prints environment or sets and executes command.                                                                                   |
| `lsblk`     | Lists block devices.                                                                                                               |

## Id

The `id` command expands on the `whoami` command and prints out our effective group membership and IDs. This can be of interest to penetration testers looking to see what access a user may have and sysadmins looking to audit account permissions and group membership. In this output, the `hackthebox` group is of interest because it is non-standard, the `adm` group means that the user can read log files in `/var/log` and could potentially gain access to sensitive information, membership in the `sudo` group is of particular interest as this means our user can run some or all commands as the all-powerful `root` user. Sudo rights could help us escalate privileges or could be a sign to a sysadmin that they may need to audit permissions and group memberships to remove any access that is not required for a given user to carry out their day-to-day tasks.

```bash
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ id
uid=1000(cry0l1t3) gid=1000(cry0l1t3) groups=1000(cry0l1t3),1337(hackthebox),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),116(lpadmin),126(sambashare)
```

## Uname

Running `uname -a` will print all information about the machine in a specific order: kernel name, hostname, the kernel release, kernel version, machine hardware name, and operating system.

```bash
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ uname -a
Linux box 4.15.0-99-generic#100-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 22 20:32:56 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

From the above command, we can see that the kernel name is `Linux`, the hostname is `box`, the kernel release is `4.15.0-99-generic`, the kernel version is `#100-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 22 20:32:56 UTC 2020`, and so on.

If we type `man uname` in our terminal, we will bring up the man page for the command, which will show the possible options we can run with the command and the results.

## Uname to Obtain Kernel Release

Suppose we want to print out the kernel release to search for potential kernel exploits quickly. We can type `uname -r` to obtain this information.

With this info, we could go and search for "4.15.0-99-generic exploit," and the first [result](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47163) immediately appears useful to us.
